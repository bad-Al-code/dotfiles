# Dotfiles Repository

Welcome to my dotfiles repository! This space houses configurations for various tools and applications that I use daily.

## Tools and Applications I Use

### Window Manager

- **i3**: My window manager of choice. The configuration is located in [i3/config](i3/config).

### Neovim

- **LazyVim**: I've adopted LazyVim, a preconfigured Neovim distribution. This choice streamlines my Neovim setup and includes various enhancements out of the box.

## How to Use

Feel free to explore and adapt these configurations to suit your preferences. To use them:

1. Clone the repository.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dotfiles.git
   ```

2. Copy or symlink the desired configuration files to the appropriate locations in your system.
